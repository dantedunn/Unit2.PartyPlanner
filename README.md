# Unit2.PartyPlanner


 1. A user enters the website and finds a list of the names, dates, times, locations, and descriptions of all the parties that are happening.

2. Next to each party in the list is a delete button. The user clicks the delete button for one of the parties. That party is then removed from the list.

3. There is also a form that allows the user to enter information about a new party that they want to schedule. After filling out the form and submitting it, the user observes their party added to the list of parties.

Getting Started
There is no starter code for this workshop; the solutions to previous activities will be great to review!



Which components can be created directly in the HTML? Which components need to be created in JavaScript?
Can you render mock data to the page?
Can you render real data to the page?
Are you able to fetch an array of all the parties from the API?
Is state correctly updated to match the data from the API?
Are you passing the correct arguments to fetch?
Does the API return an error? If so, what is the error message?
Is there an event listener on the form? Does it correctly add a new party to the list of parties?
Is there an event listener attached to each delete button? Does it correctly remove a party from the list of parties?
Extensions
If you are done early, explore the rsvps and guests endpoints of the API.
